#Chess: science, sport or art?
hi

If you were to choose one adjective for chess which one would you choose? 
Perhaps you think none of these adjectives go with the term "chess", and you'd rather just 
define it as a game. If that's the case, why do you think it can't be considered any of the above? 



Leave your thoughts here:

- Ben: My mind is swole as hell
- Tiejun: I don't like anything but Hollo Knight. But it's too hard.
- George: Chess is good
- Bobby fisher against the world is an interesting film
- Ferran: Hello world
- George: Changing via the website


- Tiejun: I just forked ya project!
